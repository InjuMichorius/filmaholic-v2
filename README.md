# Filmaholic v2.0 üéûÔ∏è
![](https://github.com/InjuMichorius/Filmaholic/blob/master/images/README%20images/READMECOVER.JPG)

Filmaholic is a school project I made that rates the suitability of movies based on it's audience using an API. The user can visit a movie, sort the movies (based on date, votes and alphabet) and search for a specific movie. This application is a continuation of my other project called Filmaholic.

# Goal üí™üèª
The goal of Filmaholic is to provide its audience with information about movies, so they can make a decision on what to watch. They can also search a movie to see other people's opinions. This application will show the overall rating of any movie using the The Movie DataBase API.

# API üóÇÔ∏è
I made use of [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for this project.
The base endpoint is https://api.themoviedb.org/. All endpoints return either a JSON object or an array. The endpoints I use are popular and ID. This is the structure of one movie array:

```json
{
  "adult": false,
  "backdrop_path":"/8tNX8s3j1O0eqilOQkuroRLyOZA.jpg"
  "genre_ids" [14,28,12],
  "id":458576,"original_language":"en",
  "original_title":"Monster Hunter",
  "overview":"A portal transports Cpt. Artemis and an elite unit of soldiers to a strange world where powerful monsters rule with deadly ferocity.",
  "popularity":3079.082,
  "poster_path":"/uwjaCH7PiWrkz7oWJ4fcL3xGrb0.jpg",
  "release_date":"2020-12-03",
  "title":"Monster Hunter",
  "video":false,
  "vote_average":7.3,
  "vote_count":869
}
```

The api url needs 3 things.
* The base URL (https://api.themoviedb.org/)
* The endpoint (popular)
* The API key (?api_key=0a00a0a0aaa0aa00a0000a0000a0a0a0)

The returning array will contain movies, which you can acces with result[0] up to result[20]. To acces more movies, you'll need to navigate to the next page.

# Design patterns and Best Practices üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
__Code standards are important__ when working on any project; your code stays *consistent* and is *readable* for everyone. I defined code standards for __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JS__ while working on this project.

## Javascript code standards
* Variables & functions are written in __camelCase__
* Promises are handled with __async functions__ using await
* I don't use var, only __const__ or __let__
* I put __spaces around operators__ ( = + - * / ) and after commas (exception for for loops)
* I use indentation with __TAB__
* I always end a statement with a __semi-colon;__
* Functions have their opening bracket on the __same line__ as the name, with 1 space in between
* I use __ES6 syntax__ where possible

## CSS code standards
* I try to avoid __!important__ as much as possible
* Layout/general styling is always __above__ more specific styling
* Selectors are not unnecessary __long__ nor __short__
* I use __CSS3 syntax__ where possible
* I avoid old display properties like float
* CSS Selectors must have a __space__ between the name and bracket

## HTML code standards
* I only use IDs when the element is present __once__ on a page and it's necessary for styling or Javascript
* I always write semantic HTML according to __W3C Validator__
* Divs are only used when __necessary__ for styling purposes
* Classes allow easy __re-usage__
* Indentation is always __clear__
